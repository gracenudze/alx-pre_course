This is my second readme
I created the bash, c and js directories and created empty files for these directories
I created two additional files and wrote some lines those files using echo
Afterwards, I created a new git branc and checked out where I created another empty file: bash/98
I modified the bash/ALX and bash/School files which were the initial files i wrote some lines in
I added all the files, commited them and pushed.
